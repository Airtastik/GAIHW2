It can be added as part of a more complex behavior tree structure.\r\nFuture Improvements\r\nTo make the behavior tree more robust and meet the requirement of having at least three types of composite nodes, you can:\r\n\r\nAdd a Sequence Node:\r\n\r\nCombine multiple actions (e.g., avoid walls and then chase the boid) into a sequence.\r\nAdd a Selector Node:\r\n\r\nCombine multiple conditions (e.g., check if the boid has reached the goal or if a wall is ahead) into a selector.\r\nAdd a Decorator Node:\r\n\r\nModify the behavior of an action or condition (e.g., invert the result of a condition).\r\nSummary\r\nThe behavior tree for the EnemyBoid is implemented with the following nodes:\r\n\r\nAction Nodes: Perform specific actions like spinning, moving to the center, avoiding walls, and chasing the boid.\r\nCondition Nodes: Evaluate conditions like whether a wall is ahead and decide which action to execute.\r\nThe behavior tree is simple but effective, allowing the enemy to dynamically decide its actions based on the environment. Future enhancements can include additional composite nodes to make the behavior more complex and flexible. Let me know if you'd like help implementing these improvements!\r\n\r\nPart 3:\r\nFor the\r\nHere's a detailed description of the behavior tree nodes and their purposes:\r\n\r\nBase Node Types\r\nDecisionNode (Abstract Base Class)\r\nProvides common interface for all nodes\r\nReturns steering vector for behavior execution\r\nComposite Nodes\r\nSequenceNode\r\nPurpose:\r\n\r\nUsed for behaviors that require multiple steps\r\nAll children must succeed for sequence to succeed\r\nUsed in complex maneuvers like \"dodge enemy AND move to goal\"\r\nSelectorNode\r\nPurpose:\r\n\r\nProvides fallback behaviors\r\nUsed for decision making between alternatives\r\nExample: \"chase OR wander OR return to center\"\r\nDecorator Nodes\r\nInverterNode\r\nPurpose:\r\n\r\nCreates NOT conditions\r\nUsed to invert behavior conditions\r\nExample: \"NOT near wall\"\r\nRandomNode\r\nPurpose:\r\n\r\nAdds non-deterministic behavior\r\nMakes enemy less predictable\r\nUsed for varying tactics\r\nRepeaterNode\r\nPurpose:\r\n\r\nCreates persistent behaviors\r\nUsed for sustained actions\r\nExample: \"Continue chasing for X updates\"\r\nAction Nodes\r\nActionNode\r\nPurpose:\r\n\r\nPerforms actual steering behaviors\r\nExamples: chase, flee, wander\r\nEnemyAvoidanceNode\r\nPurpose:\r\n\r\nHandles collision avoidance\r\nCalculates safe paths around obstacles\r\nTree Structure\r\nThis structure creates intelligent behavior where the boid:\r\n\r\nPrioritizes survival (enemy avoidance)\r\nUses random tactics when threatened\r\nFalls back to normal pathfinding when safe\r\nAlways maintains obstacle avoidance\r\n"

              "content": "Here's a 400-word condensed version of the Behavior Tree Implementation:\n\n# Boid Behavior Tree System\n\n## Core Structure\nThe behavior system uses a binary decision tree with two main behaviors:\n- **Evasive** (when enemy detected)\n- **Normal** (default pathfinding)\n\n### Key Components\n\n#### 1. Decision Node\n```cpp\nclass DecisionNode {\n    virtual sf::Vector2f makeDecision(const Kinematic& current,\n                                    const Kinematic& target,\n                                    const Kinematic& enemy,\n                                    const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& map,\n                                    int tileSize) = 0;\n};\n```\n\n#### 2. Primary Decision Branch\n- Enemy detection radius: 200 units\n- Evaluates distance to enemy\n- Chooses between evasive or normal behavior\n\n#### 3. Evasive Actions\nThree randomized maneuvers:\n```cpp\nsf::Vector2f randomFlank();\nsf::Vector2f randomDodge(); \nsf::Vector2f randomBurst();\n```\n\n#### 4. Normal Pathfinding\n- Uses arrive steering behavior\n- Includes obstacle avoidance\n- Follows waypoints\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Tree Construction\n```cpp\nvoid boid::buildDecisionTree() {\n    // Create evasive node with random tactics\n    auto evasiveNode = new ActionNode([this](/*params*/) {\n        int choice = rand() % 3;\n        switch(choice) {\n            case 0: return randomFlank();\n            case 1: return randomDodge();\n            case 2: return randomBurst();\n        }\n    });\n\n    // Create normal pathfinding node\n    auto normalNode = new ActionNode([this](/*params*/) {\n        return arrive->calculate(k, t);\n    });\n\n    // Build decision tree\n    decisionTree = new DecisionBranch(\n        [](/*params*/) { return enemyDistance < DETECTION_RADIUS; },\n        evasiveNode,  // True branch\n        normalNode    // False branch\n    );\n}\n```\n\n### Key Features\n- **Exception handling** for robustness\n- **Boundary checks** prevent out-of-bounds\n- **Speed limiting** for realistic movement\n- **Obstacle avoidance** via map data\n\n### Usage\nThe tree is evaluated each update:\n```cpp\nsf::Vector2f steering = decisionTree->makeDecision(\n    kinematic, targetKin, enemyKin, mapData, tileSize\n);\n```\n\nThis produces intelligent behavior where boids:\n1. Detect nearby enemies\n2. Choose appropriate evasive tactics\n3. Return to normal pathfinding when safe\n4. Maintain obstacle avoidance throughout"

The enemy also limits its speed to ensure realistic movement and dynamically adjusts its velocity and orientation based on its current behavior. For the **LearningEnemy** variant, the enemy records gameplay data, such as the boid's position, velocity, and map layout, to train a decision tree. This allows it to predict actions based on environmental states, enabling it to adapt and improve its behavior over time. The learning system balances between predefined fallback actions and learned behaviors, making the enemy more effective in chasing or evading as it gains experience."

Below is the updated `CMakeLists.txt` file:\n\n```cmake\n# filepath: c:\\Users\\Trist\\Documents\\GitHub\\GAIHW2\\CMakeLists.txt\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16) # Compatible with Ubuntu 20.04\nproject(CMakeSFMLProject LANGUAGES CXX)\n\n# Set the output directory for the compiled binaries\nset(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin)\n\n# Set the C++ standard\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)\n\n# Option to build shared libraries\noption(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS \"Build shared libraries\" OFF)\n\n# Include FetchContent to download dependencies\ninclude(FetchContent)\n\n# Fetch SFML library\nFetchContent_Declare(SFML\n    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/SFML/SFML.git\n    GIT_TAG 2.6.2\n    GIT_SHALLOW ON\n    EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\n    SYSTEM)\nFetchContent_MakeAvailable(SFML)\n\n# Add the executable and source files\nadd_executable(main src/main.cpp src/path.cpp src/learned_behavior.cpp src/learning_enemy.cpp src/boid.cpp src/enemy_boid.cpp)\n\n# Link SFML libraries\ntarget_link_libraries(main PRIVATE sfml-graphics sfml-window sfml-system)\n\n# Add include directories\ntarget_include_directories(main PRIVATE include)\n\n# Compiler settings for Ubuntu\nif(UNIX AND NOT WIN32)\n    # Enable all warnings and treat warnings as errors\n    target_compile_options(main PRIVATE -Wall -Wextra -Werror)\n    \n    # Link pthread for multithreading support\n    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE pthread)\nendif()\n\n# Additional settings for Windows (if needed in the future)\nif(WIN32)\n    # Windows-specific settings can go here\nendif()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **CMake Version**: Changed `cmake_minimum_required` to `3.16`, which is compatible with Ubuntu 20.04.\n2. **C++ Standard**: Explicitly set `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` to 17 and made it required.\n3. **SFML Linking**: Added `sfml-window` and `sfml-system` to the `target_link_libraries` to ensure all SFML components are linked.\n4. **Include Directories**: Added `include` as the directory for header files.\n5. **Compiler Warnings**: Added `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` for stricter compilation on Unix systems.\n6. **Pthread Linking**: Linked `pthread` for multithreading support, which is often required on Linux systems.\n\n### Instructions for Ubuntu 20.04:\n1. Install dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt update\n   sudo apt install build-essential cmake libsfml-dev\n   ```\n2. Create a build directory and compile:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir build\n   cd build\n   cmake ..\n   make\n   ```\n3. Run the compiled binary:\n   ```bash\n   ./bin/main\n   ``` \n\nThis setup ensures compatibility with Ubuntu 20.04 and provides a robust build configuration."
